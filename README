Summary
Audioedit has the ability to remove samples from the beginning and the end of wav files.

Compiling
To compile, simply run gcc with the included source files: 'gcc -o audioedit audioedit.c audio.c'.

Testing Methods
Various methods were used for testing.
  1. Unit tests were written for each function.
  2. A test script with a dataset was created and run on the application (including both good and bad input data).
  3. The test script was used for regression testing.
Test scripts are available in the ./tests folder. Datasets are available by request.

Extensions
Audioedit has accounted for many parts of the WAVE file specification. 
It supports unknown chunk types and unconventional chunk arrangements (eg. fmt following data).
Multiple channel support is also included.

Limitations
Audioedit is unable to handle WAVE files with malformed/incorrect data chunk sizes.
