Summary
Audioedit is an audio editing program capable of removing samples from the beginning and the end of wav files.

Compiling
To compile, simply run gcc with the included source files: 'gcc -o audioedit audioedit.c audio.c'.

Testing Methods
Various methods were used for testing.
  1. Unit tests were written for each function.
  2. A test script with a dataset was created and run on the application (including both good and bad input data).
  3. The test script was used for regression testing.

Extensions
Audioedit has accounted for a number of chunk types defined by the WAVE file specification. 
It supports unknown chunk types and unconventional chunk arrangements (eg. fmt following data).
Multiple channel support is also included.
Finally, an audio reverse feature has been added.

Limitations
Audioedit is unable to handle WAVE files with malformed/incorrect data chunk sizes.
Additionally, audioedit is unable handle large files, since the entire file is loaded into memory.
The maximum editable file size is defined by the memory available to heap allocation.
